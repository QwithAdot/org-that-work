		<h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            Hello, I'm Quentin, a passionated being by Live Action Role Playing games, Burning Man-like events, performing arts, and sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal here is to make organizations able to create the best working environments and get the best of the people to be able to build the right solutions with high quality.
        </p>

        <p>
            As each context is different, there is no one-solution-fits-all. The approach is the solution:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Agnostic --</b> An approach driven by the mindsets goes beyond the one driven by the tools</li>
                <li><b>Tailored-made --</b> The people and the organization make their own solutions</li>
                <li><b>Hands-on --</b> Creating is a process of trial and failure, only allowed by doing</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My values are central in my approach:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Human --</b> Individuals and their interactions make organizations</li>
                <li><b>Trust --</b> Collaboration creates great things when based on trust</li>
                <li><b>Simplicity --</b> Everyone in the organization should be able to understand how it works</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            With my approach, I help organizations of any size and any kind, teams, and individuals. The will to change is more important than anything else! To this end, my offer includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Coaching</li>
                <li>Practical and theoretical trainings</li>
                <li>Workshops</li>
                <li>Facilitation</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            I mainly focus on Agile, Lean, Design Thinking, and self-organization which include different tools and frameworks: eXtreme Programming, Scrum, Kanban, Holacracy, Objectives & Key Results, User Story Mapping, ... All together they are the toolbox I take with me for every mission.
        </p>

        <p>
            Everything starts with a discussion to understand your context and your need. Then weâ€™ll define a shared goal, the way to reach it and the length of the mission. 
        </p>
