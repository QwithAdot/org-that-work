<BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
	<p>
		Hello, I'm Quentin, a being passionated by Live Action Role Playing
		games, Burning Man-like events, performing arts, and sciences.
	</p>
	<p>
		My goal here is to make organizations able to create the best working
		environments and get the best of the people to be able to build the
		right solutions with high quality.
	</p>

	<p>
		As each context is different, there is no one-solution-fits-all. The
		approach is the solution:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Agnostic &#X2500;</b> An approach driven by the mindsets goes
				beyond the one driven by the tools
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Tailored-made &#X2500;</b> The people and the organization make
				their own solutions
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Hands-on &#X2500;</b> Creating is a process of trial and failure,
				only allowed by doing
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		My values are central in my approach:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Human &#X2500;</b> Individuals and their interactions make organizations
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Trust &#X2500;</b> Collaboration creates great things when based
				on trust
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Simplicity &#X2500;</b> Everyone in the organization should be
				able to understand how it works
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		With my approach, I help organizations of any size and any kind, teams,
		and individuals. The will to change is more important than anything
		else! To this end, my offer includes:
		<ul>
			<li>Coaching</li>
			<li>Practical and theoretical trainings</li>
			<li>Workshops</li>
			<li>Facilitation</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		I mainly focus on Agile, Lean, Design Thinking, and self-organization
		which include different tools and frameworks: eXtreme Programming,
		Scrum, Kanban, Holacracy, Objectives & Key Results, User Story Mapping,
		... All together they are the toolbox I take with me for every mission.
	</p>

	<p>
		Everything starts with a discussion to understand your context and your
		need. Then weâ€™ll define a shared goal, the way to reach it and the
		length of the mission.
